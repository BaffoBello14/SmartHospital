# Smart Hospital

Welcome to the Smart Hospital project for the Internet of Things (IoT) course at the University of Pisa, as part of the "Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering" program in the academic year 2022/2023.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Smart Hospital application:

1. Insert the dongles into the virtual machine.

2. Select the dongles from the device list in the virtual machine interface.

3. Execute 'flash_all.sh.'

4. Wait for all the dongles to flash red.

5. Select the dongles again.

6. Run 'flash_all.sh' once more.

7. Select the dongles one final time.

8. Execute 'execute_all.sh.'

This will not only run the dongles but also start the Java application, create, and initialize the database.

## About the Project

The Smart Hospital project is designed to showcase how IoT technology can enhance hospital operations. It integrates dongles, virtual machines, and Java applications to create an intelligent hospital environment.
